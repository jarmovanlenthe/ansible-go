Go
========

Ansible role that installs [Go](https://golang.org/). The latest stable release that has been compiled for x86 64-bit Linux systems is installed by default, and different platforms and versions are supported by modifying the role variables.

Role Variables
--------------

By default, ansible-go detects the latest version of Go using github tags and version sort and checks if that version is already installed.
If not, it downloads the tarball from the official mirror (if there's not already a file with matching SHA256 checksum), verifies the GPG signature, and extracts it in `/usr/local/src/`.

You can install a specific version of Go (e.g. if you are installing on FreeBSD, or if you need to use an earlier release) by setting the `go_version` variable. A list of versions can be found on the [Go Downloads page](https://golang.org/dl/).
E.g. `go_version: "1.10"`.

The `go_tarball_checksum` variable controls how the integrity of the downloaded tarball is validated.
See the ansible [documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/get_url_module.html) for details and syntax (`checksum` field).
Tarball checksums can be found on the [Go Download Page](https://golang.org/dl/).

For more options, check the [default](defaults/main.yml) variables.

Updating Google's Linux Package Signing Keys

According to [this page](https://www.google.com/linuxrepositories/), the latest version of the keys for the GPG signature can be found [here](https://dl.google.com/linux/linux_signing_key.pub).
